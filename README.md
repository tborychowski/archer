# TP-Link Archer stats

Retrieve per-device traffic stats (upload + download) from the TP-Link Archer router.


### Set-up

1. Install dependencies
    ```sh
    yarn
    ```
2. Rename `config-sample.json` to `config.json` and update details. Devicemap is to show the nice names in the output, instead of (often) ugly names (or codes).


### Run

```sh
node .
```
